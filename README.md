# DeepCRF: Neural Networks and CRFs for Sequence Labeling
A implementation of Conditional Random Fields (CRFs) with Deep Learning Method.

DeepCRF is a sequene labeling library that uses neural networks and CRFs in Python using Chainer, a flexible deep learning framework.

## Features
DeepCRF provides following features.
- Bi-LSTM / Bi-GRU / Bi-RNN
- CNN for character-level representation
- Pre-trained word embedding
- Pre-trained character embedding
- CRFs at output layer
- CoNLL format input/output
- Raw text data input/output
- Training : Your variable files
- Test : Raw text file at command-line
- Evaluation : F-measure, Accuracy

## Plan 
- First release : 2017-05-12
